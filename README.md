# Data Source

# Data Modelling
___
This is a crucial step in Tableau to ensure that the analysis is accurate and effective. It involves building relationships between tables, creating calculated fields and optimizing the data structure for insightful visualizations. Here I had to create a relationship between the tables to ensure seamless interactions.

# Skills Demonstrated
___
Data cleaning was done in Ms Excel before it was imported into the Tableau workspace. Since I had already cleaned the data, there was almost no need for data shaping and re-structuring. I went on to work on the calculated fields, creating custom calculations using mathematical functions and formulas to drive new metrics. Next, I moved to creating visualizations using different charts and a map for location. This in effect brought out the data storytelling in a clear and compelling way. These visuals were now used to develop an interactive dashboard.
